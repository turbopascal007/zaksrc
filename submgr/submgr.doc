First of all, SubMgr is FREE.  I have seen too many cheesy programs which have
tons of messages promoting the author's BBS, and then ask for money as well.

If you like SubMgr, or have any suggestions on improvements for future
releases, feel free to send me netmail.

I hate writing documents!  

Sub-Mgr is easy to set up!

Dump it in your main slbbs directory that contains config.sl2 for 
 whatever node, and then run it!  It needs "standard" comm support!

- Version History ---------
 v1.00 - worked
 v1.01 - added some highlighting and an error message for lame users
 v1.02 - added more support for attributes and access levels..
         one of the sltpu routines didn't work as advertised..
---------------------------

 Guess What?!
  Sub-Mgr was created with Searchlight Programmer's Library and, holy cow,
  some Portions Copyright (c) 1991 Searchlight Software.
