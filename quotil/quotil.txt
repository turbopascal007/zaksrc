Ok...   I wrote this for a few reasons...  one was that a few people had
asked for such a program in the Searchlight echo in fidonet, another was 
that I had nothing better to do on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  

Ok.. on to the good stuff...  Put this program in your autologin batch
file, and make sure it is ran while in the same directory for THAT NODE's
CONFIG.SL2..  It will display a line that says it's name and if it toggled
quotes on or off for this call..  The line in only displayed on the local
side.
