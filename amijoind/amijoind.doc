 History. . .   
   v1.04  - Hopefully fixes the "internal program error"
            also now abides the "Subboard Visible" flag

   v1.03  - Fixed the "close-subboard-names-error" (fred-1,fred-2)

   v1.02  - Fixed a small data assignment error...

   v1.01  - If user is in ansi mode, it highlights the subboards, and other-
            wise uses a '*' still.

 Simply run AmIJoinD from the directory containing CONFIG.SL2 and it will
 do the rest.  It pays attention to attributes & access levels.

 You can install it as a door using the above procedure, or you can install
 it as an extension of the 1-Member command.  I included my MEMBER.MNU 
 (renamed to SEE-ME.MNU for safety)  Take a look at it with MENU.EXE and
 that should be enough to get you started.
