---(Quick Version History)---
   v1.01 - due to the fact that, as of version 2.25 of SEARCHLIGHT, it 
           does not "DO" metacharacters on the DOOR Command lines, I added
           support for the "\SB" metacharacter INTERNALLY to PUSHIGH.

   initial release - worked fine.
---(Back to Docs)---

Ok.. you asked for it.  simple it is.

This util will push the high message pointer for the specified user
to the highest value in the specified subboards.

Pushigh needs config.sl2 in the current directory, it will do the rest.

params.

pushigh  user_name [+subname] [-subname] [/all]

 user_name - %U from SL. ZAK_SMITH and WINNIE_THE_POOH are good.

 +subname  - include this dir in push high list.
             (sub must allready be joined)

 -subname  - exclude this dir from push high list.
             (sub must allready be joined)
             (if a dir is in both - and +, it is included)

 /ALL      - push high all joined directories. 
             (subs must allready be joined)


examples - 
pushigh zak_smith /all -mail -general -updates
  -> pushed high all but mail, general, and updates
  I can't say what will happen when you push high in MAIL, cause I don't know.
