Listfile works with the same command line switches as SLDIR, with
one exception.  Here is a summary...

Listfile [access] [/dirname] [-dirname] [=string] [!NOT] [NDLC] [ONE]
         [$file]

  $file      - name of the outout file (ex: $AllFiles.Lst)

  access     - lowest access to scan dirs

  /dirname   - scan only these dirnames

  -dirname   - do not scan these dirs

  =string    - search for this string in filename,and all descriptions

  !NOT       - do not provide any header information in file
                 (useful for scanning for a string)

  NDLC       - No DownLoad Counters.  Strips the times downloaded from the 
               listing.

  ONE        - Puts the whole description, including extended, on the same 
               line as the file name.  This extends the text file produced
               beyond 80 columns.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LISTFILE.TXT - this file is optional, if it exists in your text file
               directory (per CONFIG.EXE), it will be included before
               the directory listing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you are having troubles, here is the logic that decides whether
 to list the particular dir or not..

  If (
     access of dir is higher than specified, and
     it's not in the exclude list, and
     there is no include list or it's in the include list
     )  - OR -
     it's in the include list

 This seemed the most logical way to do things..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
d:\slbbs> listfile /games /fishing
  ...scans games and fishing

d:\slbbs> listfile 30
  ...scans all that require 30 or higher access

d:\slbbs> listfile 5 -games -graphics
  ...scans all that require access of 5 or higher, but not games or graphics

d:\slbbs> listfile 50 =searchlight !not
  ...scans all that require access of 50 or higher,
      and include "Searchlight" somewhere in the file description,
      without the directory headers.
