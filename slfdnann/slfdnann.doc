-[ Version History ]------------------------------------------------------------
 1.00    initial release
 1.01    fixed bug with "FROM" keyword
         added code so that you don't have to delete the old *.TIC's
 1.02    fixed date bug.
 1.03    fixed a sl color code thing.
         added up to 50 "outbound" dirs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This reads all the *.TIC files in a specified directory and then posts
 announcement messages in subboards you want.   I use this when I hatch 
 a file..

 As of version 1.01, SlFdnAnn will store the filenames that have already
 been processed in SLFDNANN.DAT.  I added this because sometimes I forgot
 to delete the old TIC files in my outbound directory, and slfdnann would
 report them again.. now it won't....  If you want to re-announce the files,
 just delete slfdnann.DAT...
 
 -- CONFIGUARION --

 Edit the SLFdnAnn.CFG file to change the paths, etc to suit your system.
