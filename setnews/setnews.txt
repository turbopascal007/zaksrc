Ok..  This will rename a file to the last subboard of the current
user on.

Here is how I have set it up.

---[ auto login batch ]---
copy g:\slbbs\text\newssub.txt g:\slbbs\text\tempsub.txt > nul
setnews tempsub.txt
---[ end ]---
Newssub.txt is in my TEXT file dir for Searchlight.  It contains what
used to be in SUBA.TXT (the sl1.77 version) ..  The first line copies it
and then the second line renames it to <lastsubboard>.txt ..

It will display a short line..

..on the local crt only.  <ie: not on the remote end>

SETNEWS has *NOT* been tested extensively, although if I screwed up this
simple program, I think my programming days are limited, heh.

the end.
