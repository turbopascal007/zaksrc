SLBBS Source Code..
-------------------
Zak Smith, Oct 6, 1995.
I restructed the zipfile to make 
sure everything was happy.
I do not see myself doing any programming
for SL in the future, and I haven't touched
any of my source code in 1.6 years. 
Someone asked about possibly buying the 
source for one of my programs, but I just 
decided to give it out free.
