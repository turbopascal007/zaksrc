Dired - the file directory editor for the Searchlight BBS System v2.25+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am distributing DirEd free of charge because I feel there is a need for
freely available, quality software (not to mention that some people are 
asking money for _really_ cheesy programs).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use at your own risk!  I will not take blame if DirEd eats your computer!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DirEd now requires about 91k free ram to run.

I have tried to make the program as self-explanatory as possible.  The only
thing you might need to get started is the optional command line parameters.

Command Line Parameters: (optional)
   DIRED /p <path> /l <xx> /b /f
     <path> - path to CONFIG.SL2 <not needed if CONFIG.SL2 is in current dir>
     <xx>   - number of lines per screen.  used for EGA and 
              VGA systems that are running in one of the
              following modes:
                25 lines <default>
                43 lines <ega>
                50 lines <vga>
     /b     - Use bios calls instead of direct screen writes.  This 
              option makes the screen updates much slower, but it may
              be useful if you are running in DESQview.
     /f     - This does not update the status line when scanning the
              file directories.  I added this so that if you are using
              Dired remotely, it will not take so long to scan, because
              it will not update the screen as much.

Directory Screen:
    Use Up, Down, Home, End keys to move through list of directories.
    ESCAPE will exit the program. ENTER (or RETURN) will open the 
    directory that the scroll bar is on, and then it will scan the directory.

File Screen:
    Use Up, Down, Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End keys to move around in
    the file listing.  The Enter (or Return) key will edit the current file's
    description.  If you leave the first line of the extended description 
    blank, then you will not get a chance to edit the second line, and
    it will be blanked. Escape will exit to the Directory Screen.  An
    ASCII #249 (a dot in the middle of the character block) means that there
    is an extended description associated with that file.  The * and the +
    after the file names are the same as in Searchlight.  ALT-C will CLEAR
    the password (if any) for the current file..  ALT-E or F2 will show who
    uploaded the file, when, it's size in bytes, and how many times it has
    been downloaded.  ALT-P will let you update a password on a file..

Limitations:
    Dired can handle a maximun of 5,000 files in any directory.  (It does
    not matter if you have more than 5,000 in several direectories added
    together, as Dired only processes one directory at a time.)  Dired 
    can handle a maximum of 200 file directories.  
        These can be expanded in later versions if needed.  I have *NOT* 
    tested Dired on directories which are close to the limit, 5,000.
    The highest number of files I *HAVE* tested is about 1050, which is 
    probably less than the number you have in any single on of your 
    directories. Because of the file handling procedures, it *MAY* run out 
    of stack space when loading VERY large directories, but this should 
    not be a problem.
        
Error Handling (..or not..):
    If Dired encouters an error while trying to open or read any of the
    system files, it should clear the screen and produce a message that
    says something like: 
      ERROR 2: Program Terminated: Error opening/reading CONFIG.SL2
    If a non-file related error occurs, the program should terminate
    and produce an error message like the following:
      Run-Time error nnn at xxxx:yyyy
    If this happens, remember the nnn code, and what you were doing right
    before it crashed.  Somehow, try to get this information to me.  This 
    is the only way I will be able to fix the error.

-[ Version History ]-----------------------------------------------------------
1.11 - 09/12/92 - Fixed a few bugs in the file listing..
                  DirEd also now will automatically detect how many rows are
                  on the screen (for instance, vga 50, ega 43, vga 28, etc..)
                  and use all of them.
                  Also added Password Modification function (alt-p)

1.10 - 09/06/92 - Updated all file handling routines with my new ones..
                  These are much more reliable and will not grunge your
                  directories.

1.02 - 05/13/91 - Added the F2/ALT-E and ALT-C functions.  Also further
                  reduced stack requirements for scanning the file dir
                  to only 12 bytes per level.

1.01 - 05/11/91 - Same Day!  Reduced stack requirements for scanning the
                  file dir by about 600 bytes per level.  (only a 2 line
                  source change.. I might add..)

1.00 - 05/11/91 - First release ..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DirEd was written using no outisde function libraries.
