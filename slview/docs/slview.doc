SLView (c) copyright 1993 by Zak Smith all rights reserved, etc..

PLEASE NOTE!
  Zak will take no blame for any damages made to hardware or software
  which occur as a result of this product.  All I can say is that it
  works fine on my system (and my alpha tester's systems). 


Beta Notice:
  This release is a beta which means that you can register it if you would
  like to.  It also means that I am not finished developing it, so it may
  change; I need a broader base of testers.  Please reply to me some way
  if you find any bugs, etc, improvements..


SLView allows users to look into archives on your system and view or
download their contents.

Setup SLView is easy.  
  þ dump it (slview.exe and archive.cfg) in the dir with config.sl2
  þ add it as a door command in your file system
              command: slview.exe
                 path: .
        comm. support: standard or force-color
                abort: none
            drop file: none

If you want to change the default compression schemes, edit ARCHIVE.CFG
to reflect your tastes.

I was going to give out SLView for free, but then I thought, "Gee, I could
use a CD-ROM drive or a new monitor." 

If you enjoy SLVIEW, a gift of $20.00 (US) would be appreciated.  If you
choose to register it, you will receive a .KEY file in netmail that will
remove the "Unregistered" notice and the nonsense in the begining..
