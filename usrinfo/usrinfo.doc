USRINFO - Yet Another Information Gatherer for Users
          (C) 1991 by Zak Smith all rights reserved

USRINFO is free.  Do with it what you want.  

I'm not sure what USRINFO does, but it seems that if you type
USRINFO C fred flintstone
from the command line something happens.. I think the general syntax for 
that is
USRINFO [color code (C,M,N)] [User Name]

It creates 2 files...  
USRMAIL.TXT - a text file with info of current user..  you can use
              slmail to mail this to the sysop if you want.

USRINFO.LOG - A text file containing most of the information from the users.
              A line is added every time USRINFO is run.

USRINFO does not have any com port support - you must use SL's.

I am not planning to update this program, but I might if someone wants
something changed.   If you want something more flexible, use Super Survey,
which, I think, is available through Searchlight software and Frank LaRosa.

Later...
