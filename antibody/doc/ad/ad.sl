\cy As of this version, it requires a FOSSIL driver such as X00 or BNU.
 I am planning to make a FOSSIL driver optional in a future version, in
 case you do not need one for anything else.

 Uses an archive program definition text file that allows the addition of 
 any other archive programs.  Number of formats limited only by available
 memory.

 Allows a text file of filespecs to reject.  Current limit is 40 filespecs;
 but I can add more easily if anyone needs more.

 The distributed demo version operates fully when current user the SYSOP.
 (for evaluation)  A registered, fully functional version is available
 (of course) {see documentation}.

 Current release is version \ye1.02b\cy (revision b).
