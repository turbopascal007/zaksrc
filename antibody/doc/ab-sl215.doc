
 Now you are probably thinking "What about those users who use Xmodem?"

   Well, I have a solution for that also. 

   First, use XSYS and MSYS and a text editor to change the text in
   STRINGS.SYS that say "Xmodem", "Xmodem/CRC", and "Xmodem/1K" to
   "<unassigned>". The result should look like this

   xxxx '<unassigned>'
   xxxx '<unassigned>'
   xxxx '<unassigned>'

   (xxxx would be the line number)

     If you do not know how to use XSYS and MSYS then you should use these
     commands:
      XSYS STRINGS.SYS > STRINGS.TXT
      ( edit STRINGS.TXT here )
      MSYS STRINGS.TXT STRINGS.SYS
  
   Now, all you have to do is make sure no users have these 3 protocols 
   selected.  To do this, you must run NOTXMDM.EXE in your AutoLogin Door.
   Add this line into your AutoLogin door. (your batch file or AutoDoor
   section in CONFIG)  It must be run from the directory containing the
   CONFIG.SL2 for that directory.
 
     NOTXMDM X

   Where X is the protocol number you want them to have.  I have my 12th
   external protocol as XModem (using the DSZ protocol driver), so my line
   is: NOTXMDM 12
