  AntiBody is distributed in a DEMO mode, in which it will only process
  any files if the current user is the SYSOP.  I have done this because
  I feel it allows for adequate evaluation.  If the current user is the
  SysOp, AntiBody will function fully.

  If you wish to use AntiBody to its full ability, you must register it
  by paying $20. In return you will then receive a small KEY file which 
  contains your SLBBS registration number and your BBS name.  This file
  will allow you to run all future versions of AntiBody also.

  AntiBody has performed correctly on the author's machine for well over
  two months,  and has no  known bugs,  but I (Zak Smith) cannot be held 
  responsible for any damage to data, software, or hardware.

캑 Quick Setup 쳐컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 - Create a directory called ANTIBODY off your main SLBBS directory.
         MD \SLBBS\ANTIBODY

 - Put all the files in the ANTIBxxx.a_Z archive in this directory.
   ('xxx' is version number, 'a' is revision code)

   If you are running more than one node, create a directory for each
   node under the directory which contains that node's CONFIG.SL2 and 
   copy ANTIBODY into each.

 - Make sure you have PKUNPAK.EXE, ARJ.EXE, LHARC.EXE, ZOO.EXE, PKUNZIP.EXE,
   PKZIP.EXE, and SCAN.EXE in the PATH.

 - Add to SLBBS's CONFIG as 'Upload Autodoor' 

  Upload Autodoor

   1. Command ....................... ANTIBODY.EXE
   2. Directory Path ................ \SLBBS\ANTIBODY\
   3. Communications Support ........ None
   4. Abort Method .................. None
   5. Write Protection .............. No

 Note:
   This default setup assumes that ANTIBODY is a "child" directory of 
   the one which contains CONFIG.SL2. 
   (AntiBody resides in \SLBBS\ANTIBODY, and Config.SL2 is in \SLBBS)

 - Adding Files to Reject file list.
    With a text editor, such as Qedit, or the 2-SysOp/TextEdit edit
    a file in the AntiBody directory named REJECT.LST.  Each line should
    be a filespec to reject.  See REJECT.LST included for examples.
    Wild Cards are allowed, and work like "smart" wilcards.
     ie: *h*.zip matches ghi.zip

캑 How to Evaluate AntiBody 쳐컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  The easiest (and most realistic way) to evaluate AntiBody is to call
  from another computer as SYSOP and upload something and watch it work.

  If you do not have access to another modem, you can use AntiBody in a
  local mode.  Login locally to SLBBS and then press ALT-X to exit. Next,  
  copy some files into the UPLOADS.BBS directory which is located off of
  your main SLBBS directory containing the CONFIG.SL2.  Now go to the
  ANTIBODY directory and just type ANTIBODY, and it will process the files.

캑 Going Further 쳐컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   If you are still using SLBBS v2.15 (or any version without the upload
   autodoor), read the file, AB-SL215.DOC, which explains how to stop
   the use of the internal Xmodem protocols in SLBBS.

 Archive Program Configuration

   Compression and Decompression program configuration is kept in
   ARCHIVE.CFG.  This file should be in the main ANTIBODY directory.

   The format of it is as follows..

     ; format to convert TO
     ;
     ToArc: ProgID, Program,  Parameters
     ;
     ; Normal Archive Formats
     ;
     Un: ProgID,  Program,         Parameters,      Compression ID Block
     ;
     ; Self Extract Formats
     ;
     UnSfx: ProgID, Program, Parameters,  Compression ID Block

   Examples are in ARCHIVE.CFG included in this archive.


캑 Options 쳐컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

 AntiBody needs no command line parameters, it only requires that it be
 run from it's "home" directory.  Executing with the single command line
 parameter CONFIG will invoke AntiBody's self-configuration mode.  

 This will be displayed...                 Meaning...
 
                  Path to CONFIG.SL2 ..\
                    Path to AntiBody .\
                  Path for Bad files .\BADFILE\
            Scan Subboards for Dupes TRUE
               Use Split Screen Mode TRUE
  Graphics info for GIF descriptions VideoMode
 *  GIF resolution at Start of Desc. TRUE

   The last line (marked with *) will only be displayed if the one before it
   is set to "Resolution".

   Setting "Scan Subboards for Dupes" to TRUE or YES will enable AntiBody
   to scan all the file subboards for a duplicate filename.  A duplicate
   may occur when a user uploads more files than he entered filenames
   for in a batch upload (and SLBBS doesn't check afterwards).

   If you are having video troubles, set "Split Screen Mode" to FALSE
   or NO.  Split Screen mode will be disabled automatically if it
   senses DESQview is active, because split screen mode creates the
   dreaded "Error #13" under DESQview.

   If you have "Graphics info for GIF descriptions" set to VideoMode,
   AntiBody will add the video mode of the file to the beginning of the
   description, based of number of colors.  Here are the codes.

     S: SuperVGA - More than 16 colors -or- Image larger than 640x480
     V: VGA      - More than 16 colors
     E: EGA      - More than 4 colors
     C: CGA      - 4 or less colors

  If you have "Graphics info for GIF descriptions" set to Resolution,
  you will have the Choice to put the Resolution at the beginging
  of the description, or at the end of the last line of the description.
  Here is the general format of a resolution code.

   WWWxHHHxCCC where WWW is width, HHH is height, and CCC is number of colors

  This default setup    쳐 SLBBS 컴컴컴컴
  would work in a directory structure    쳐 ANTIBODY 커
  like this if AntiBody was executed from             쳐컴컴 BADFILE
  \SLBBS\ANTIBODY

 Note: AntiBody's "home" directory and the path for Bad files should be
       on the same drive.  If not, the virus infected files will simply
       be deleted, not moved to the Bad directory.

캑 What it Requires 쳐컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 AntiBody needs to find SCAN.EXE in your PATH statement.

 AntiBody requires a FOSSIL driver, such as X00 or BNU, to be active
 in memory.
