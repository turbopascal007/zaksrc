WHATSNEW is being distributed on the SHAREWARE principle.  You may 
freely distribute the UNREGISTERED version of WHATSNEW.  WHATSNEW and
it's documentation are (c) copyright 1991 by Zak Smith All Rights Reserved.

You may use only use WHATSNEW for an ammount of time that is sufficient
for evaluation.  If you wish to use WHATSNEW for a longer ammount of time, 
you must register it.  

The REGISTERED version removes the 5 second delay, the 4 short beeps, and the
three "Braglines".

The Registered version allows WHATSNEW to meld exactly with the SEARCHLIGHT 
interface.

See WHATSNEW.REG for more information.

-[ Version History ]-----------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.20E - Preliminary fix for SL v3.0 

Version 2.20D - Fixed the 'abcde-1', 'abcde-2' subboard name bug.

Version 2.20C - Added Access Attribute support for File section.  Will only
                display new files from a directory if the user has all  the
                attributes needed.  WHATSNEW now also displays the revision
                letter in the header.

Version 2.20B - If the user's lastread pointer is less than the first actual
                message, the number of messages on that subboard is shown as
                new.

Version 2.20A - Finally fixed a bug which only showed new files for that
                day..

Version 2.20  - Added the abort option, and now WHATSNEW can also show only
                the new files or messages.  This version is much faster than
                the previous version.

Version  2.1B - Fixed another bug which incorrectly reported the number of
                files.  NOW it works..

Version  2.1A - Fixed one small bug which added an extra line between the
                Message and Files listing if you speicified the WIDE option
                and there were personal messages in the last subboard listed.

Version  2.1  - This is the first Shareware version.  It adds many features,
                including a status line, MAIN.* support, asking if the user
                wants to see WHATSNEW, page and MORE prompt support, and 
                many more.

Revision 2    - This fixes a minor bug in reporting the number of new files. 
                The previous version was by a day off in it's caclulations. 
                (it didn't count files uploaded on the day of the user's last
                login) Also will Set ERRORLEVEL of 1 is nothing new. This might 
                be useful in a batch file to send a message or something.

 WHATSNEW was written using no outside function libraries.

-[ General Theory ]------------------------------------------------------------

WHATSNEW will display a list of the subboards and file directories that have
new messages or files, and how many in each area.  WHATSNEW does NOT process
the MAIL subboard, as it is checked by Searchlight just after the bulletins, 
and the fact that it is handled differently than the other subboards. 

-[ Running WHATSNEW ]----------------------------------------------------------

To run WHATSNEW, simply run WHATSNEW from the command line, it will then 
read CONFIG.SL2 and get everything it needs to know from there.

-[ Controlling WHATSNEW ]------------------------------------------------------

There are three methods to control WHATSNEW.  You can use the configuration
mode of WHATSNEW, an environment variable, or command line parameters.  
Command line parameters have priority over the environment variable, and the 
environment variable has priority over the options configured by using the 
configuration mode of WHATSNEW.  The only way to save options is to use the
configuration mode of WHATSNEW.

 Command Line and Environment Variable 
       * Environment Variable set by using SET WHATSNEW=... in AUTOEXEC.BAT

   WHATSNEW path /[no]WIDE /[no]BRAG /[no]PAGES /[no]CFGCOLORS
                 /[no]CLEARSCR /[no]STATUS /[no]ASK /[no]ANSIASK 
                 /[no]SHOWFILES /[no]SHOWMSGS /[no]ALLOWABORT /CONFIG

   o path      - path to CONFIG.SL2 for the current node.  Defaults to the 
                 current directory.
 
   o WIDE      - Prevents display of the subboard or directory description.

   o BRAG      - Shows the program title and copyright information.

  o PAGES      - Enables the --more-- prompt.

  o CFGCOLORS  - Uses colors configured in CONFIG.SL2.

  o CLEARSCR   - Clears screen before displaying list.

  o STATUS     - Uses the local status line on 25th row.

  o ASK        - Asks user if they with to see WHATSNEW.

  o NOANSIASK  - Prevents the Light-Bar style question.  Use this only
                 if the local cursor coordinates are different than the
                 remote coordinates caused by a program that only displays 
                 on the local console.  You can prevent this problem by 
                 running WHATSNEW as the first program in your LOGIN
                 AUTODOOR batchfile.

  o SHOWFILES - Shows the new files. [default]

  o SHOWMSGS  - Shows the new messages. [default]

  o ALLOWABORT- Allows user abort.

  o CONFIG    - Invokes the Configuration mode of WHATSNEW.  

  Prefixing any option with NO gives it the opposite effect.

  The Configuration mode of WHATSNEW will NOT work if WHATSNEW has 
  been compressed using PKLITE, LZEXE or any such program.  If this
  does occur, you can still control WHATSNEW by using command line
  parameters or the environment variable.

-[ Output ]--------------------------------------------------------------------

WHATSNEW will add "- Personal" after the subboard listing if there are
any messages addressed to the user that they have not read.

Error Levels.
 WHATSNEW will return one of three possible error levels when run. 
  0 - WHATSNEW was run and completed successfully.
  1 - There was nothing new for this user.
  2 - User answered NO to yes/no question.
