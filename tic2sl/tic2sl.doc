Tic2Sl v2.00 <c> copyright 1992 by Zak Smith all rights reserved

DOC's?  You've got to be kidding?

v2.0 should be much faster than the older version!

Tic2Sl must now be run from a directory that has a CONFIG.SL2 in it!

Here is the *NEW* command line structure:

\db\tick\tic2sl PASCAL   files.dsc
\db\tick\tic2sl SOFTDIST files.dsc
\db\tick\tic2sl OS2      files.dsc
\db\tick\tic2sl SL200    files.dsc

"PASCAL" is the name of the SLBBS DIR SUBBOARD..

it ASSUMES the "files.dsc" is in the same dir as the files (.zip, etc)
of the directory..

Here is the change to tic.cfg that must be made:

ListName Files.dsc
listfmt %3:-13/%1:-160

The ListFmt MUST be like that.. it is very important.

If there is a 3rd command line param 
 (like
  tic2sl os2 files.dsc GRR
 ), tic2sl will kill files.dsc after it is done.
